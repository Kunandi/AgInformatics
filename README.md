# Documents and Problem Sets for CSES 7960 - AgInformatics: Python Programming for the Applied Sciences

#### Developed by Dr. Scott McElroy, Professor, Department of Crop, Soil, and Environmental Sciences at Auburn University

The class [SYLLABUS](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/AginformaticsClassSyllabus2018.docx) is available.  Please take a look.  I suggest one of two books for the class [The Self-Taught Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Taught-Programmer-Definitive-Programming-Professionally-ebook/dp/B01M01YDQA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525742659&sr=8-1&keywords=the+self+taught+programmer) is a great starter but it is in Python 3 and the class is primarily Python 2 (class will change in near future).  Second is [Python for Informatics](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Informatics-Exploring-Information-ebook/dp/B00K0O8HFQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1525742737&sr=1-3&keywords=python+for+informatics) which is a good general starter text and it is written for Python 2 (at least the version I have is). The most important resource is Google.  Can't find an answer? -- Google it.  Didn't find an answer after Googling it? -- Google it a different way.

Sections:

1.  [Variables, Objects, and Mathematical Operations](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/variables.md)

2.  [Conditional Statements and Iteration (Loops)](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/conditionalIteration.md)

3.  [Functions](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/functions.md)

	[__Side note__: Programming Tips](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/lectureTopics/sidenotes.md)

4. [Try/Except Statements](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/lectureTopics/tryExcept.md)

5.  [Opening Files](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/lectureTopics/openFiles.md)

6.  [Object Oriented Programming I](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/lectureTopics/oopI.md)

7.  Object Oriented Programming II

8.  Introduction to Pandas and Numpy
	a.  Opening tables, CSV, and Excel Files 
	b.  Searching through tables

9.  [Regular Expressions](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/lectureTopics/regularExpressions.md)

10.  An Introduction to the Command Line

11.  [Os and Sys Modules](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/lectureTopics/osSys.md)

12.  [Git and Github](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/lectureTopics/gitNotes.md)

I highly recommend this for learning _git_:  [Codecademy Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git).  It has a fee but it is well worth it.
