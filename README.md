# Documents and Problem Sets for CSES 7960 - AgInformatics: Python Programming for the Applied Sciences

#### Developed by Dr. Scott McElroy, Professor, Department of Crop, Soil, and Environmental Sciences at Auburn University

The class [SYLLABUS](https://github.com/mcelrjo/AgInformatics/blob/master/AginformaticsClassSyllabus2018.docx) is available.  Please take a look.  I suggest one of two books for the class [The Self-Taught Programmer] is a great starter but it is in Python 3 and the class is primarily Python 2 (class will change in near future).  Second is [Python for Informatics]() which is a good general starter text and it is written for Python 2 (at least the version I have is). The most important resource is Google.  Can't find an answer? -- Google it.  Didn't find an answer after Googling it? -- Google it a different way.
